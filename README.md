# Google Calendar Timer

A simple google calendar timer that you can change the time, date and timezone manually. Soon I will change it to be automatic with the current date

How to use it:
```
python3 activitytimer.py
Choose your account
Accept access to your profile for the api to add the event
```
## "The authentication flow has completed. You may close this window." should pop up
